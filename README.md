# Regression-analysis
This is a code sample to show different regression analysis in R. Please access the **"Regression_analysis.md"** file for better visualization.

The analysis explores the current gender pay gap in the nonprofit sector using finance data collected from tax reports (From 990) and made electronically available to the public by the IRS. 

The regressions performed include:

(1) A OLS naive model of Salary onto Gender without any controls; 

(2) Salary onto Gender while controlling for fixed effects and other variables (FE model); 

(3) Difference in Difference comparison for the treatment of Gender change (DD model); and 

(4) Salary regressed onto Gender and NP revenue, while taking into account the interaction between gender and revenue.

Note: Extensive and detailed comments have been included to show a clear understanding of the procedures.
